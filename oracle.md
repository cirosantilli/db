Closed source.

Often refered to by the version numbers, e.g. "Oracle 11g" or "Oracle 12g".

Meaning of the letters I could find:

- `i`: internet
- `g`: grid
- `c`: cloud

Apparently those map to different architectures,
whatever that means considering it's closed source.

Default port: 1521 in older versions, 2843, 2844 in more recent ones.

## XE

11g has a free version called Express Version ("EX"):

with max 10GB storage, 1GB RAM and 1 core.
